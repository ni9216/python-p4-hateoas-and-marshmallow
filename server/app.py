'''
In simpler terms, when a client interacts with a RESTful API, the server includes hypermedia links in the response, providing information about other related resources or actions that the client can take. These links enable the client to navigate the application's state without having prior knowledge of the entire API.

Using Marshmallow, our models are serialized after they've been generated. This means that we can remove all of the SQLAlchemy-Serializer code from models.py:

That's it! Marshmallow will require us to modify some code in our app in addition to writing a schema for serialization, but it stays out of our models entirely.

Marshmallow decides how to present the data from your database according to a schema, or blueprint. This is a similar idea to a schema in SQL, but make sure you don't get them confused: a serializer's schema informs a server how to present data. A database schema informs a server how to store data.

A Marshmallow instance must be instantiated after our database. The interpreter will throw all sorts of errors if we do it before!

Instances of this schema can be used to convert Newsletter objects to JSON and vice versa in a Flask application. The hyperlinks provide additional navigation information, following the principles of HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State).
